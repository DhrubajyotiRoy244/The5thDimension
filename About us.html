    <p>The Robotics Club at NIT Patna was formed around 2015-16 with the aim of fostering interest in robotics,
        automation, and emerging technologies among students. Since its inception, the club has built a strong legacy of
        enthusiastic members who have actively engaged in hands-on projects, technical workshops, and collaborative
        learning activities. Over the years, the club has served as a platform for students to explore practical
        applications of engineering concepts, develop problem-solving skills, and grow through continuous
        experimentation and innovation.
        The Robotics Club of National Institute of Technology Patna was established around 2015-16 by faculty and
        student pioneers who had a passion for robotics and automation. Since its inception, the club has grown into a
        vibrant community of tech enthusiasts from diverse backgrounds, including hardware, software, electronics, and
        design.
        The club's mission is to introduce students to the world of robotics, automation, and embedded systems, and to
        provide a platform for hands-on learning through projects, workshops, and competitions. Members work
        collaboratively to build innovative robots, explore emerging technologies, and apply theoretical knowledge in
        practical environments
        Over the years, the Robotics Club has organized and participated in a range of events and technical challenges,
        helping students develop real-world skills in areas such as mechanical design, sensor integration,
        microcontroller programming, and system automation. It also regularly conducts workshops, training sessions, and
        peer-learning activities to support members at all expertise levels.
        Through teamwork, experimentation, and creativity, the club aims to foster a culture of innovation and
        problem-solving among the student body while representing NIT Patna in both intra-college and national-level
        competitions.
